"""The database is the central point for all other parts of the CTF framework.
It is a HTTP REST interface that sits between the actual MySQL database and
the other components. It allows all other components to report on the state of
the game or query the state of the game.

The database API follows some basic design guidelines:

- Every endpoint that modifies the state of the database is a POST request.
- Every endpoint that only serves data but does not modify anything is a GET
  request.
- If multiple parameters can be passed to an endpoint, they are (generally) in
  alphabetical order. In some cases, the name of the parameter is omitted
  because the association is clear, e.g., we use
  ``/service/state/set/<service_id>`` instead of
  ``/servce/state/set/service/<service_id>``.
